							<h2 class="subsubheader">What We Do</h2>
							<p>Representatives of the SRO work to make sure that the student body feels like their voices are heard when it comes to the administration making decisions. The decisions of the administration certainly affect every single student, which is why this organization aims to ensure that the students’ opinions are taken into consideration. Representatives survey, poll, and ask students within their cohort about relevant topics and issues at Dutchtown High in regards to administration decision-making.

							<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
							<p> Representatives would connect with students on what their needs and wants are and then relay it to administrators so that it may be considered in big decisions. 
							They must meet at least once at least every two weeks with the ambassadors to relay the current consensus of what their students want. If necessary, certain class issues can be spoken with the respective principal or counselor for their cohort upon consulting an ambassador.
